PROJECT NAME

Immunization Tracking

DESCRIPTION

Pitch: As a parent, it's hard to keep track of your child's immunization records! Especially if you move states, or switch doctors.  It's a pain to call around and figure out which immunizations your child still needs, or to have them mail you proof for things like school registration.  As an adult, it's even harder to access these records for travel that requires immunizations or booster shots. This app allows medical professionals to upload immunization records to your personal or family account.

MVP:
1. Onboading process for a user (and ability for parents to add their children to their account)
2. Onboarding process for medical professionals/office staff
3. Ability for office staff to input immunization name, date received, and place received into a person's file.
4. Ability for user to grant permission for an office staff account to edit their immunization records. (The user can't edit it themself, only grant permission to their doctor's office).
5. Overview homepage for a user to see a summary of received and missing immunizations.
6. Homepage for office staff to see all patients that have granted them permission to edit their records. Single page view for each patient as well.

Stretch: Ability for office staff to upload a pdf form as proof of immunization. Ability for user to download a pdf summarizing the name and date of each immunization.
